# Multimodal RAG App for Medical App
This is a **Generative AI** project designed to make it easier to understand and analyze **medical documents**, and is designed to perform multimodal **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, which integrates text-based and image-based content extraction, summarization, and intelligent question-answering. By combining **Generative AI models** and **deep learning**, this project leverages the power of **large language models (LLMs)** and **image-captioning models** to process and interpret medical data, including text, tables, and images from PDF documents. The result is a system that can provide detailed, context-aware answers to questions about medical planning, even when the information spans multiple modalities.

## Features
- **Langchain Integration**: Utilizes Langchain for LLM chains, embeddings, vector stores, and more.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Implements RAG architecture, allowing for efficient retrieval and generation of text and multimodal content.
- **FAISS Vector Store**: Employs FAISS to store and retrieve vector embeddings for fast similarity searches.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Apache Airflow
- Langchain
- FAISS
- OpenAI API
